This dataset contains a zip file that include three folder. Train - Test - Valid
So you can use them as your input directory and create some image classification with CNN, Yolo or SSD.

Description:
Here are a few use cases for this project:

1- Dental Practice Automation: This model can be used by dental clinics and hospitals to quickly and accurately analyze dental X-rays, helping dentists efficiently identify dental issues and recommend appropriate treatment plans for patients.

2- Dental Insurance Claims Processing: Insurance companies can use the model to verify dental issues mentioned in the claims submitted by dentists or patients, ensuring accuracy and reducing fraudulent claims.

3- Dental Education and Training: Teaching institutions and dental schools can use the model to help train future dentists by providing them with instant feedback and diagnosis during their practice sessions with X-ray images, enhancing their learning experience.

4- Remote Dental Consultations: The model can be used in telemedicine or remote dental consultation services for providing preliminary diagnosis and recommendations, particularly in regions where access to dental care professionals is limited.

5- Dental Research: Researchers studying dental health, dental disease progression, or the effectiveness of various dental treatments can use this model to assist in large-scale analysis of dental radiography datasets, enabling them to uncover trends and patterns more quickly and accurately.
