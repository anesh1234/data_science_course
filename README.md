# CS4020 Project Spring 25
## Setting up the environment
A requirements.txt file was made so that anyone easily can reproduce our Python environment. We have used Python 3.12 for this project, and working with environments in this version is detailed at [Python Docs](https://docs.python.org/3.12/tutorial/venv.html).
In short, to create a compatible Python 3.12 virtual environment for this project, run:
```Shell
python3.12 -m venv .venv
```
Then import the requirements into the environment:
```Shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
